# Environmental Vulnerability Disclosures (EVD)

This repository is part of the cve.earth project, aimed at cataloging and 
tracking corporate environmental vulnerabilities in a standardized format. 
It serves as a space where individuals, organizations, researchers, and 
activists can report corporate environmental issues, follow the status of 
these issues, and contribute to resolving them, much like the CVE process 
for cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

## Getting Started

To report an environmental vulnerability, create a new issue using the 
Environmental Vulnerability Disclosure form. Provide as much detail as 
possible, using available evidence and references. 

### Prerequisites

You need a GitHub account to create an issue. If you do not have an 
account, you can create one [here](https://github.com/join).

### Reporting a vulnerability

1. Go to the [Issues](<Link to the issues page>) tab in the repository.
2. Click on `New issue`.
3. Select `Get started` next to the `Environmental Vulnerability 
Disclosure` template.
4. Fill in the form with as much detail as you can provide. Required 
fields are marked with `*`.
5. Once you have filled in all the necessary information, click `Submit 
new issue`.

## Understanding an EVD

Every issue submitted creates a new EVD in our database. Each EVD has a 
unique identifier and contains information about the company involved, the 
nature of the environmental risk, evidence, potential impact, and any 
other relevant details. The issue also has a status, which changes as we 
verify the report, investigate the problem, and track the company's 
remediation efforts.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. You can contribute in several ways:

- **Reporting vulnerabilities:** This is the most straightforward way to contribute. If you know of a corporate action causing environmental harm, report it.

- **Researching reported vulnerabilities:** We need help verifying the information in the reports, investigating the reported companies, and updating the status of the issues.

- **Improving processes and templates:** If you have suggestions for improving our reporting templates, processes, or any other aspect of the project, we'd love to hear from you. You can open an issue labeled 'improvement' or 'suggestion' to share your ideas.

- **Legal assistance:** If you are a legal professional or firm interested in environmental cases, please get in touch. We're building a network of legal resources to suggest to potential whistleblowers. 

- **Spreading the word:** The more people know about this project, the more effective it will be. Share it on social media, with your colleagues, at your school, or anywhere else you can.

Before contributing, please read our [Code of Conduct](<Link to the Code of Conduct>).

**Note:** Due to legal risks, cve.earth is not a platform for whistleblowing. If you have sensitive information, we recommend you seek legal counsel and consider more secure channels for disclosure.
